    <h1>Seminar Reading </h1>
    <p>1. “Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions.”</p>
    <p> This quote from the article made me realize that before beginning the design process, it is essential to establish a clear and purposeful goal. 
    To question and understand what the main focus of the prototype, designers can ensure that their efforts are addressing the right aspects of the problem. 
    Therefore, this will make the prototype more effective.</p>

   <p> 2.“What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.” </p>
   <p> I found this quote interesting in relation to the question, “Is a brick a prototype?” It provides a good answer to me: a prototype can be almost anything, depending on how it is used. 
    What matters is not the medium or tool used to create it, but how designers employ it to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact. A prototype’s meaning lies in its context. 
    It’s show the designers use it to communicate ideas and help others see and understand their intentions through it.</p>


   <p> 3. “From what they learned in their simple field test, they knew immediately that they should try to think beyond standard rectilinear notebook computer forms.” </p>
   <p>This quote inspired me that it’s important to test and make physical prototypes at all stages. Sometimes, when people actually hold the prototype in hands, they will suddenly see new ideas without noticing. 
    It’s also a good way to extract from the process, and play around with it with a different mindset.</p>
