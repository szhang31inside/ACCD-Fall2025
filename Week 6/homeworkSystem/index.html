       <p>My Process </p>
       I started by setting up the canvas and creating a main School object to control the system. 
       Then I used object-oriented programming to make separate classes for the teacher and the students, 
       so each one has its own properties and behaviors. I programmed the teacher to teach students within 
       a certain range, which slowly increases their knowledge. The students move around the canvas on their 
       own, and their color changes as they learn more. I also added interaction so that when I click on the 
       canvas, a new student is added.
